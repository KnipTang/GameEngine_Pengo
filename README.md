# Pengo

This remake of Pengo for the SEGA from 1982 has been developed in C++ using the self-made custom [KnipTang-GameEngine](https://github.com/KnipTang/KnipTang-Engine).

# Goal

Pengo was developed as a proof of operation of the [KnipTang-GameEngine](https://github.com/KnipTang/KnipTang-Engine).

# Use

Download the latest release of this project and compile/run in visual studio.

The different Game Modes can be triggered by pressing 1 for Single Player, 2 for Co-Op, or 3 for Versus mode in the start menu.

Pengo can be controlled by WASD and E for attack.
The second player in Co-Op or Versus mode can be controlled by the arrow keys and RSHIFT for attack.
Controller support has also been added for both players as an alternative to the keyboard controls.

Sound can be muted/unmuted by pressing M.
